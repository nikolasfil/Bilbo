By: Oscar Wilde.The Importance of Being Earnest; Oscar Wilde's hilariously scattered tale of mistaken identities, back room engagements, and amourous entanglements brings joy and laughter to its readers more than one hundred years after its original publication in 1895.

The Irishman was always known for his wit and humor and in this comedy of entanglements he shows us once again. All you have to do is read the title to see that Wilde is already kidding us. If we read it the first time and do not pay attention to it, we may not see anything strange, but if we take a look at the original title, The importance of being Earnest, more carefully, then things change. The literal translation would be The importance of being serious. So, here we see that Wilde plays with the words because it can refer to the name of Ernesto or the fact of being frank, serious ... So we already see that this title has a double meaning and this is reflected in the plot of the work . It is true that it is a comedy of entanglements that contains a hilarious humor and unique phrases that make you think and all this is narrated in an elegant way and with a great class. Very typical of Wilde. However, behind this comedy hides something more because in it is a criticism of Victorian society.I am a lover of this era but we must also recognize that it was a society based on conventions and with very strict codes of morality. Those known as "gentlemen" were men that people admired because of their class and apparent perfection. They did not hide anything and they were very transparent ... or not. Many of these men and the upper class in general lived from appearances and a false seriousness. That image of perfection was, in fact, a lie since many had a secret life, or secret vices, that they tried to hide since, if they were discovered that idealized image that they had of them would break. Wilde criticized this behavior and in this work decides to make fun of this idea of (false) moral. Wilde was also taken by an admirable gentleman, but no one knew of his sexual tendencies and in the end, when his secret was discovered, he was condemned. The importance of being called Ernesto was his last work since after his fall came. Ironies of life, it seems that his story turned against him since he was one more victim of the society he criticized so much.In the characters of The importance of being called Ernesto, we can see that they are perfect for the public but the reader discovers that this is not the case since we can see that they have certain secrets that do not make them so good and innocent. Frivolity and falsehood are the order of the day. Many people reading the work may not realize this and for many is a comedy, but criticism of this society is evident. What happens is that our beloved Oscar expressed everything through a comedy and people did not see beyond the bizarre situations presented. I disguised everything in the form of satire and this says a lot about these people as it seemed that they did not see beyond a comedy that made them give a loud laugh at the minimum. If I had presented it as a serious and formal work, maybe things would have been different.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '172680903X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781726809030'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 58, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNoRvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNoRvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=tNoRvQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=tNoRvQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_Annotate.html?hl=&id=tNoRvQEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tNoRvQEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Annotations This book is unique because it contains a literary criticism that was made by Juan AcevedoI bring an entry dedicated to the importance of being called Ernesto, one of the best works, if not the best, of the always brilliant ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'fMd1zgEACAAJ', 'etag': 'mdA4XZytlYY', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fMd1zgEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Importance of Being Earnest a Trivial Comedy for Serious People', 'subtitle': 'By Oscar Wilde', 'authors': ['Oscar Wilde'], 'publishedDate': '2020-03-31', 'description': "The Importance of Being Earnest A Trivial Comedy for Serious People Oscar Wilde The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Some contemporary reviews praised the play's humour and the culmination of Wilde's artistic career, while others were cautious about its lack of social messages. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment. Despite the play's early success, Wilde's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances. After his release from prison, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work. The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell; The Importance of Being Earnest (1992) by Kurt Baker used an all-black cast; and Oliver Parker's The Importance of Being Earnest (2002) incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production. After the success of Wilde's plays Lady Windermere's Fan and A Woman of No Importance, Wilde's producers urged him to write further plays. In July 1894, he mooted his idea for The Importance of Being Earnest to George Alexander, the actor-manager of the St James's Theatre. Wilde spent the summer with his family at Worthing, where he wrote the play quickly in August. His fame now at its peak, he used the working title Lady Lancing to avoid preemptive speculation of its content. Many names and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known; Lady Queensberry, Lord Alfred Douglas's mother, for example, lived at Bracknell.", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9798632478564'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 48, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=fMd1zgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=fMd1zgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_a_Trivia.html?hl=&id=fMd1zgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fMd1zgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'The Importance of Being Earnest A Trivial Comedy for Serious People Oscar Wilde The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'KK2nmQEACAAJ', 'etag': 'jtiI5syzljg', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KK2nmQEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Works of Oscar Wilde', 'subtitle': 'The Importance of Being Earnest, a Trivial Comedy for Serious People', 'authors': ['Oscar Wilde'], 'publishedDate': '1999-01-01', 'description': 'This Elibron Classics title is a reprint of the original edition published by Methuen and Co. in London, 1908.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0543865142'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780543865144'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 202, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KK2nmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KK2nmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=KK2nmQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=KK2nmQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+A+Trivial+Comedy+for+Serious+People+by+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Works_of_Oscar_Wilde.html?hl=&id=KK2nmQEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KK2nmQEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'This Elibron Classics title is a reprint of the original edition published by Methuen and Co. in London, 1908.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'gcICMQAACAAJ', 'etag': 'dv/sXijbh7c', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gcICMQAACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Importance of Being Earnest', 'authors': ['Oscar Wilde'], 'publishedDate': '2016-11-05', 'description': "The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde.

The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play\'s very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles. Wilde managed both to engage with and to mock the genre, while providing social commentary and offering reform. The play was first produced at the St James\'s Theatre on Valentine\'s Day 1895. It was freezing cold but Wilde arrived dressed in "florid sobriety", wearing a green carnation. The audience, according to one report, "included many members of the great and good, former cabinet ministers and privy councillors, as well as actors, writers, academics, and enthusiasts". Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled to Hesketh Pearson that "In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night".

Algernon lives in London and says he has a sick friend in the country. He uses visits to his imaginary friend to get out of things. His best friend, Ernest, is also Jack and is doing the exact same thing. Misunderstandings abound in this comedy. 'The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.', '...in married life three is company and two is none.' Is this play a 'unique work of art' as Oscar Wilde believed? Or, as a first-night reviewer claimed in 1895, it 'represents nothing, means nothing, is nothing'?
