He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name. 'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said. A nod was the answer. Synopsis Wuthering Heights, written by Emily Bronte, depicts the story of life in northern England between 1771 till 1783.

A Glimpse Inside Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.--I dine between twelve and one o\'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles\' walk, arrived at Heathcliff\'s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower. Synopsis Wuthering Heights is an 1847 novel by Emily Brontë, initially published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell. It concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with Earnshaw\'s adopted son, Heathcliff. The novel was influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature, but contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, and for its challenges to Victorian morality and religious and societal values. Wuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë\'s Agnes Grey before the success of their sister Charlotte\'s novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. Charlotte edited a second edition of Wuthering Heights after Emily\'s death which was published in 1850. It has inspired an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush\'s song of the same name. "A stunning reprint" from Wombrook Publishing.

Set in the lonely and bleak Yorkshire moors, this classic tale of thwarted passion begins when the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, a Mr Lockwood, is forced to seek shelter for a night at Wuthering Heights. As the night passes, Lockwood learns of the tumultuous past of Wuthering Heights and of those connected with it. WUTHERING HEIGHTS The timeless story of Cathy and Heathcliff's tumultuous love affair, is brought to you by Simon & Schuster Classics, with a stunning, cinematic new look. WUTHERING HEIGHTS Heathcliff, a young orphan, is adopted by Catherine Earnshaw's father. Treated unkindly by her brother, Hindley, Heathcliff is at first protected by the elderly Mr Earnshaw. When the elder Earnshaw passes away, Heathcliff is hurt and betrayed by both brother and sister, and leaves… until the day he returns to exact his revenge. WUTHERING HEIGHTS Emily Brontë's demonic and brooding creation, Heathcliff, and the love-affair between him and Catherine, has fascinated and entranced readers for generations. It is a classic of gothic literature. WUTHERING HEIGHTS Published in 1845, Emily Bronte’s gothic novel set on the windy moors of Yorkshire is the story of the doomed love between Catherine Earnshaw and her father’s adopted son, Heathcliff. The book was initially poorly received by many critics who found its dark, tragic story needlessly harsh and disturbing. That opinion has not endured, and the only novel Emily Bronte published is now considered to be one of the great classics of English literature.
