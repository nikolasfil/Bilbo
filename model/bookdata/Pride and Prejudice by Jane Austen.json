George Saintsbury Compared Her To Shakespeare Whose Detachment And Elusiveness She Certainly Shares. She Was A Truly Great Novelist Of Manners Among The Country Gentry. Born In The Family Of A Rector Of Steventon In Hampshire, Jane Austen Had Her Early Education In Oxford And Reading. She Started Writing Early In Life. Between 1792 And 1798 She Completed Her First Four Novels, Lady Susan, First Impressions (Later Entitled Pride And Prejudice), Elinor And Marianne (Later Called Sense And Sensibility) And Northanger Abbey. Later She Produced Three More Novels: Mansfield Park, Emma And Persuasion. She Contracted Tuberculosis And Died Tragically Early At The Age Of 41. Although Not Recognized In Her Time, Her Popularity Has Increased, Rather Than Faded, With The Passing Of Years, Which Will Be Evident From The Remark Of F.R.

Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have been married for almost a year, and their heated arguments are a thing of the past. All that passion is now directed into more satisfying pursuits. But how long can the honeymoon last? The couple's idyllic life together at Pemberley is jeopardized by the secrets they begin keeping from each other, the troubles of their closest friends, and the threat of a villain in their midst. Layers of seemingly innocent deception are building between Darcy and Elizabeth, threatening their relationship. He is conducting some covert business dealings that he's unwilling to share with his wife, and she likewise begins keeping things from him against her own better judgment. The couple also becomes embroiled in the tribulations of Mr. Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana, and his friend and cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam falls victim to their aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as the object of her latest scheme to make a noble match for her daughter. The arrangement satisfies the ambitions of the couple's parents, but appears to hold little prospect of happiness for Anne and Fitzwilliam, who each harbor other romantic interests. During this same period, Georgiana runs the gamut of emotions as she comes of age. Her elation at her birthday ball soon crumbles when she learns the man she secretly admires is engaged to another. The excitement of a London season and the attention of two other eligible suitors cannot make her forget her disappointment over her lost first love. As the story progresses, the menacing shadow of Mr. Darcy's life-long nemesis looms ever-larger. By carelessness and design, Mr. Wickham and Lydia painfully intrude into the lives of the Darcys and the Bingleys, with disastrous results. The Darcys of Pemberley is the tale of two romances: the continuation of Darcy and Elizabeth's story, and the courtship of Miss Georgiana. For those of us who didn't want Pride and Prejudice to end, this charming novel gives the opportunity to learn what happens after the wedding, to revisit all our old friends and foes, and to share the next chapter of their lives. Ms. Winslow carries on the saga much as Jane Austen herself might have - true to her style, her sensibilities, and the delightful characters she created.", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0615517153'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780615517155'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 306, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Em1aXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Em1aXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=Em1aXwAACAAJ&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=Em1aXwAACAAJ&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Darcys_of_Pemberley.html?hl=&id=Em1aXwAACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Em1aXwAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': '&quot;The sequel to Jane Austen&#39;s beloved masterpiece, Pride &amp; prejudice&quot;--Page 4 of cover.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'pWxkzgEACAAJ', 'etag': 'O4WZScy1uAg', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pWxkzgEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Pride and Prejudice', 'subtitle': 'A Romantic Novel', 'authors': ['Jane Austen'], 'publishedDate': '2021-04-06', 'description': 'This title Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of the lists of "most loved and desired books" among literary scholars and the reading public.
