For sixty years, that\'s how Homer has begun the Iliad in English, in Richmond Lattimore\'s faithful translation—the gold standard for generations of students and general readers. This long-awaited new edition of Lattimore\'s Iliad is designed to bring the book into the twenty-first century—while leaving the poem as firmly rooted in ancient Greece as ever. Lattimore\'s elegant, fluent verses—with their memorably phrased heroic epithets and remarkable fidelity to the Greek—remain unchanged, but classicist Richard Martin has added a wealth of supplementary materials designed to aid new generations of readers. A new introduction sets the poem in the wider context of Greek life, warfare, society, and poetry, while line-by-line notes at the back of the volume offer explanations of unfamiliar terms, information about the Greek gods and heroes, and literary appreciation. A glossary and maps round out the book. The result is a volume that actively invites readers into Homer\'s poem, helping them to understand fully the worlds in which he and his heroes lived—and thus enabling them to marvel, as so many have for centuries, at Hektor and Ajax, Paris and Helen, and the devastating rage of Achilleus.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0226470490'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780226470498'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 605, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Poetry'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tb0pvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tb0pvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=tb0pvgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Odyssey+by+Homer&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=tb0pvgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Odyssey+by+Homer&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Iliad_of_Homer.html?hl=&id=tb0pvgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tb0pvgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'This long-awaited new edition of Lattimore&#39;s Iliad is designed to bring the book into the twenty-first century—while leaving the poem as firmly rooted in ancient Greece as ever.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': '9B5TswEACAAJ', 'etag': 'jP9+YlZbERg', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9B5TswEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Odyssey', 'authors': ['Samule Butler'], 'publishedDate': '2018-01-23', 'description': 'The Odyssey is one of the two major ancient Greek epic poems (the other being the Iliad) attributed to the poet Homer.

If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.
