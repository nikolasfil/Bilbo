If you want an overview of scripting tasks to consider while pen testing, this book will give you a lot of useful code or your tool kit.What You Will Learn* Find an IP address from a web page using BeautifulSoup and urllib* Discover different types of sniffers to build an intrusion detection system* Create an efficient and high-performance ping sweep and port scanner* Get to grips with making an SSID and BSSID scanner* Perform network pen-testing by attacking DDoS, DHCP and packet injecting* Fingerprint OS and network applications, and correlate common vulnerabilities* Master techniques to detect vulnerabilities in your environment and secure them* Incorporate various networks and packet sniffing techniques using Raw sockets and ScapyIn DetailPenetration testing is the use of tools and code to attack a system in order to assess its vulnerabilities to external threats. Python allows pen testers to create their own tools. Since Python is a highly valued pen-testing language, there are many native libraries and Python bindings available specifically for pen-testing tasks.Python Penetration Testing Cookbook begins by teaching you how to extract information from web pages. You will learn how to build an intrusion detection system using network sniffing techniques. Next, you will find out how to scan your networks to ensure performance and quality, and how to carry out wireless pen testing on your network to avoid cyber attacks. After that, we'll discuss the different kinds of attacks on the network. Next, you'll get to grips with designing your own torrent detection program. We'll take you through common vulnerability scenarios and then cover buffer overflow exploitation so you can detect insecure coding. Finally, you'll discover PE code injection methods to safeguard your network.", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1784399779'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781784399771'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 396, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fVvjjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fVvjjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=fVvjjwEACAAJ&dq=title:Advanced+Penetration+Testing&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=fVvjjwEACAAJ&dq=title:Advanced+Penetration+Testing&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Python_Penetration_Testing_Cookbook.html?hl=&id=fVvjjwEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fVvjjwEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Over 50+ hands-on recipes to help you pen test networks using Python, discover vulnerabilities, and find a recovery pathAbout This Book* Learn to detect and avoid various types of attack that put system privacy at risk* Enhance your ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'TWKLBAAAQBAJ', 'etag': 'TtyCr20LYc0', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TWKLBAAAQBAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Metasploit', 'subtitle': "The Penetration Tester's Guide", 'authors': ['David Kennedy', "Jim O'Gorman", 'Devon Kearns', 'Mati Aharoni'], 'publisher': 'No Starch Press', 'publishedDate': '2011-07-15', 'description': "The Metasploit Framework makes discovering, exploiting, and sharing vulnerabilities quick and relatively painless.

You’ll move on to advanced penetration testing techniques, including network reconnaissance and enumeration, client-side attacks, wireless attacks, and targeted social-engineering attacks. Learn how to: –Find and exploit unmaintained, misconfigured, and unpatched systems –Perform reconnaissance and find valuable information about your target –Bypass anti-virus technologies and circumvent security controls –Integrate Nmap, NeXpose, and Nessus with Metasploit to automate discovery –Use the Meterpreter shell to launch further attacks from inside the network –Harness standalone Metasploit utilities, third-party tools, and plug-ins –Learn how to write your own Meterpreter post exploitation modules and scripts You'll even touch on exploit discovery for zero-day research, write a fuzzer, port existing exploits into the Framework, and learn how to cover your tracks.
