The novel is set somewhere in the north of England, during the reign of George III (1760–1820), and goes through five distinct stages: Jane\'s childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she acquires friends and role models but also suffers privations and oppression; her time as the governess of Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and the finale with her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. During these sections the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo (see the Themes section below). Literary critic Jerome Beaty notes that the close first person perspective leaves the reader "too uncritically accepting of her worldview" and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives.Charlotte Brontë (21 April 1816 – 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels have become classics of English literature.

Jane Eyre is a Bildungsroman which follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.The novel revolutionised prose fiction by being the first to focus on its protagonist\'s moral and spiritual development through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the "first historian of the private consciousness", and the literary ancestor of writers like Proust and Joyce.The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane\'s individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion, and feminism. It, along with Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels of all time.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9798747862081'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 558, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1pZvzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1pZvzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=1pZvzgEACAAJ&dq=title:Jane+Eyre+An+Autobiography+by+Charlotte+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=1pZvzgEACAAJ&dq=title:Jane+Eyre+An+Autobiography+by+Charlotte+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Jane_Eyre_An_Autobiography.html?hl=&id=1pZvzgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1pZvzgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Charlotte Brontë has been called the &quot;first historian of the private consciousness&quot;, and the literary ancestor of writers like Proust and Joyce.The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': '3VIqzgEACAAJ', 'etag': 'B1P3TFIhQ98', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3VIqzgEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Jane Eyre (Illustrated)', 'authors': ['Charlotte Brontë'], 'publishedDate': '2021-01-11', 'description': 'Jane Eyre (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë.

The novel\'s setting is somewhere in the north of England, during the reign of George III (1760-1820), and goes through five distinct stages: Jane\'s childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. During these sections the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo (see the Themes section below).

She first published her works (including her best known novel, Jane Eyre) under the pen name Currer Bell. Charlotte Bront� was born in Thornton, west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1816, the third of the six children of Maria (n�e Branwell) and Patrick Bront� (formerly surnamed Brunty or Prunty), an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth, where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and a son, Branwell, to be taken care of by her sister, Elizabeth Branwell....Extrait : I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.The fiend pinning down the thief\'s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed\'s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.\'Boh! Madam Mope!\' cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty...', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1520487711'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781520487717'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 691, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=bPR0swEACAAJ&dq=title:Jane+Eyre+An+Autobiography+by+Charlotte+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=bPR0swEACAAJ&dq=title:Jane+Eyre+An+Autobiography+by+Charlotte+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Jane_Eyre.html?hl=&id=bPR0swEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bPR0swEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'During these sections the novel provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo (see the Themes section below).'}}]}
