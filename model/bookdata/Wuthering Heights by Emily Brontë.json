A Glimpse Inside Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.--I dine between twelve and one o\'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles\' walk, arrived at Heathcliff\'s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower. Synopsis Wuthering Heights is an 1847 novel by Emily Brontë, initially published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell. It concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with Earnshaw\'s adopted son, Heathcliff. The novel was influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature, but contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, and for its challenges to Victorian morality and religious and societal values. Wuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë\'s Agnes Grey before the success of their sister Charlotte\'s novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. Charlotte edited a second edition of Wuthering Heights after Emily\'s death which was published in 1850. It has inspired an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush\'s song of the same name. "A stunning reprint" from Wombrook Publishing.

Some Consider It A Gothic Novel While Others Think Of It As A Novel Of Revenge. Some Others Find In It A Romantic Tale Of Languishing Love. The Dramatic Way Of Narration By Quoting The Exact Words Spoken By The Different Characters, By Mainly Two Narrators, Nelly Dean And Lockwood, Gives The Novel A Peculiar Interest. Besides, The Portrayal Of The Character Of Heathcliff, The Protagonist, Betrays A Powerful Imagination Of The Novelist. Like Coleridge, Emily Brontë Has Been Successful In Giving The Esoteric World She Has Created, A Touch Of Reality And Credibility By Making The Supernatural A Part Of The Natural. The Novel Is A Story Of Two Houses, At Wuthering Heights And Thrushcross Grange With A Vast Moorland Separating Them. Heathcliff Comes As A Disturber Of Peace In These Two Houses And The Peace Is Restored Only With His Death. It Is Not Simply A Tragic Tale Although There Are Several Deaths In It. The Novel Shows That There Are Both Good And Evil In This World And That Evil Is Ultimately Won Over By Love.

If we evaluate the quality of books, based on the intensity of these emotions, just for that reason, Wuthering Heights (Wuthering Heights) would immediately fit like the masterpiece that is considered worldwide.For some reason, the title "Wuthering Heights," as well as others such as "Gone with the Wind" or "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s" always, since I was very young, blew my mind, even before I knew what it was. Today I know that it is because he has had a lot of fame and success in both literature and cinema, however, before reading the book he knew very little about him. The only thing I knew, or the only thing that sounded to me thanks to tiny comments that some people had released to the air, was that it seemed to be a romance story.When they told me that I would have to read it in a reduced version for the University, I did not feel more enthusiastic. I mentioned it to a couple of adults, and they all seemed to place "Wuthering Heights" in the same way that I did: as a classic love story, yes, but with nothing to remember that distinguished it from any romance and very corny.Only a very dear friend read Wuthering Heights before me, and tried to enthuse me. Even she also wrote a review, very well written by the way. But even then there was no case.Only when I read the book, even superficially because it was a grossly reduced version, I was able to realize its genius. And it is that you do not need more background, or greater literary knowledge, or more analysis to immediately fall victim to this novel.There is something I would like to make very clear: Wuthering Heights is far, far from being a conventional love story.The reduced version I liked so much, and to be reduced it produced so many sensations in my interior, that I decided to read the complete and original version, or I could never feel that I could comment on it properly. And it was worth it.Wuthering Heights is a book that can be enjoyed absolutely from any angle: superficially, it is entertaining, captivating, mysterious, brutal. And if you start to dig a little, its structure is so, but so perfect that it overwhelms me even try to explain it; For the first time I understand how there are so many books that are devoted to analyzing this work.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1728762731'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781728762739'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 218, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mA_2vAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mA_2vAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=mA_2vAEACAAJ&dq=title:Wuthering+Heights+by+Emily+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=mA_2vAEACAAJ&dq=title:Wuthering+Heights+by+Emily+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Wuthering_Heights_Annotated.html?hl=&id=mA_2vAEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mA_2vAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'annotations This book is unique because it contains: -a literary criticism when analyzing and reading the entire book elaborated by Lina MedinaLiterary criticism of the book: Wuthering HeightsPersonally, a book seems considerable to me from ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': '8_AsEAAAQBAJ', 'etag': 'vUUGRvWu66s', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8_AsEAAAQBAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Wuthering Heights - Emily Bronte', 'authors': ['Emily Bronte'], 'publisher': 'Leonardo Lumbreras', 'publishedDate': '2021-05-20', 'description': "Published in 1847, Emily Bronte's only novel Wuthering Heights is an evergreen classic. A passionate tale of love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, the novel challenged Victorian ideals of morality, class, religion and gender inequality. Heathcliff, an orphan, brought to Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw, represents the quintessential Byronic herobrooding and enigmatic, whose social status is foregrounded by his lack of a first name. Spurned by Catherine and humiliated by her brother, Hindley, Heathcliff leaves the Heights, only to return later as a revenge-seeking, wealthy and polished man. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, an antithesis to Heathcliff. What follows is a series of disastrous events in which the characters are consumed by their tragic fate. Evocative and gothic, the novel was initially termed abhorrent and later appreciated for its originality and poetic grandeur.", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783985511372'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3985511373'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 600, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.1.1.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=title:Wuthering+Heights+by+Emily+Bront%C3%AB&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 3.49, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 3.49, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8_AsEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 3490000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 3490000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}}]}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/Wuthering_Heights_Emily_Bronte-sample-epub.acsm?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/Wuthering_Heights_Emily_Bronte-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8_AsEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'What follows is a series of disastrous events in which the characters are consumed by their tragic fate.
