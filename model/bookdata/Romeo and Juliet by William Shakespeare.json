Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but, to expand the plot, developed supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris.

Everything speaks the very soul of pleasure, the high and healthy pulse of the passions: the heart beats...."-CHARACTERS OF SHAKESPEARE\'S PLAYS, by William Hazlitt, 1817THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET is sometimes spoken of as the most popular romantic love story of all time. The story\'s appeal may be the innocent young love shared by the title characters; however, the play\'s impact (as the title suggests) is in its tragedy. Shakespeare\'s theme is not love but the dangers inherent in unresolved conflicts-in this case, the lingering feud between the lovers\' families. As described in WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, by John Masefield, we see the unfortunate consequence:"Fate seemed to plot to end the folly by letting Romeo fall in love with Juliet. Let the two houses be united by marriage, as at the end of Richard III. But love is a storm, sudden love, a madness, and the fire of youth a disturber of the balances. Hate and hot blood put an end to all chance of marriage. There is nothing left but the desperate way, which is yet the wise way, recommended by the one wise man in the cast. With a little patience, this way would lead the couple to happiness.
