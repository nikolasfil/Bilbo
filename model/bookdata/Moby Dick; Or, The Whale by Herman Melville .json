The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.Dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius", the work was first published as The Whale in London in October 1851, and under its definitive title in New York in November. Hundreds of differences, mostly slight and some important, are seen between the two editions. The London publisher censored or changed sensitive passages and Melville made revisions, as well, including the last-minute change in the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in both editions as "Moby Dick", with no hyphen.Because the British edition lacked the Epilogue, which accounts for Ishmael\'s survival, it seemed that the story was told by someone who was supposed to have perished. Many reviewers in British magazines recognized a violation of the rules of fiction and criticized the author for the serious flaw. Other reviewers, however, found the book too fascinating to dismiss for these reasons. Some of the scornful British reviews were either reprinted or quoted in American periodicals, wrong-footing the American readers because they had access to the Epilogue. About 3,200 copies were sold during the author\'s life.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1976450810'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781976450815'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 128, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=kmt_tAEACAAJ&dq=title:Moby+Dick%3B+Or,+The+Whale+by+Herman+Melville&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=kmt_tAEACAAJ&dq=title:Moby+Dick%3B+Or,+The+Whale+by+Herman+Melville&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Moby_Dick_Or_the_Whale_by_Herman_Melvill.html?hl=&id=kmt_tAEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kmt_tAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Sailor Ishmael tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab&#39;s leg at the knee.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'y_2ItQEACAAJ', 'etag': 'RrTPMYV0m+o', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/y_2ItQEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Moby Dick (AmazonClassics Edition)', 'authors': ['Herman Melville'], 'publisher': 'AmazonClassics', 'publishedDate': '2017-08-22', 'description': "Featured title on PBS's The Great American Read in 2018 Ignoring prophecies of doom, the seafarer Ishmael joins the crew of a whaling expedition that is an obsession for the ship's captain, Ahab. Once maimed by the White Whale, Moby Dick, Ahab has set out on a voyage of revenge. With godlike ferocity, he surges into dangerous waters--immune to the madness of his vision, refusing to be bested by the forces of nature. An exhilarating whaling yarn, an apocalyptic theodicy, a tragic confessional, and a profound allegory, Moby Dick encompasses all that it means to be human--from the physical and metaphysical to the spiritual and emotional. Full of strange wisdom and wild digressive energy, it's a singular literary performance universally regarded as one of the great American novels.
