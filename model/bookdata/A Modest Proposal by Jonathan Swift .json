Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as Irish policy in general. In English writing, the phrase "a modest proposal" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire. Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential William Petty and the social engineering popular among followers of Francis Bacon. These lampoons include appealing to the authority of "a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London" and "the famous Psalmanazar, a native of the island Formosa." This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift\'s solution when he states, "A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout." Readers unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realize that Swift was not seriously proposing cannibalism and infanticide. The satirical element of the pamphlet is often only understood after the reader notes the allusions made by Swift to the attitudes of landlords, such as the following: "I grant this food may be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for Landlords, who as they have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title to the Children." Swift extends the conceit to get in a few jibes at England\'s mistreatment of Ireland, noting that "For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it."', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783736800762'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3736800762'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 20, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 4, 'ratingsCount': 4, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.20.21.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=title:A+Modest+Proposal+by+Jonathan+Swift&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 0.99, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 0.99, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-G1RoAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 990000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 990000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}}]}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/A_Modest_Proposal-sample-epub.acsm?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/A_Modest_Proposal-sample-pdf.acsm?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=G1RoAwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': '&quot; This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'ybAnzgEACAAJ', 'etag': '/oz2vPh52HE', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ybAnzgEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'A Modest Proposal Annotated', 'authors': ['Jonathan Swift'], 'publishedDate': '2021-01-11', 'description': 'For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland, from being a burden on their parents or country, and for making them beneficial to the public.The full title of Swift\'s pamphlet is "A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."

For this cruel and unconventional proposal Swift has been several times matched with the reputation of writers such as De Sade or Lautreamont. Already in the past, when the love of a parent for children was less felt and less obvious than today this book generated chaotic and shocked reactions in a very various range of readers. The apparently sincere style used to write the book matched with the idea of cannibalism created a strong reaction not just in readers of the past but maybe more and mainly in people that decide to read this book in our age. The sense of disgust and of disappointment is something that readers can still feel when they have to deal with this work. Provocative, fierce, sharp ... Most of the critics are divided in two different factions when the conversation arrive to this book: someone see Swift and his work as a provocative way to shake aims of Irish population but for others, mainly in the past, the author was seriously promoting the horrible solution contained in his work. Created by an intelligent man often close to political speeches and political strategies this work reflect the complex point of view of a man that was a political writer and a political journalist other than a great satire creator. A man usually more careful in his works who wanted, once, allow himself to express all his disgust for an unacceptable situation. A modest proposal: for preventing the children of poor people in Ireland from being a burden to their parents or Country, and for making them beneficial to the Public. This was the complete title of this amazing book. Too long for being acceptable during the editing step it has been reduced to "a modest proposal" among the years. The book express a deep contempt for the English politic in Ireland, even if the main accent is put on this contempt the author for sure doesn\'t forget to complain about the weakness showed by the Irish population. The proposal contained in the book is everything except than modest, with a fierce and sometimes horrific economical point of view the author, presented in the book as a character, make a plan to solve the problem of the overpopulation among Christian Irish.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1508684626'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781508684626'}],

Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed. The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland\'s rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation. The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland\'s complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1707149283'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781707149285'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 47, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yDrBywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yDrBywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=yDrBywEACAAJ&dq=title:A+Modest+Proposal+by+Jonathan+Swift&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=yDrBywEACAAJ&dq=title:A+Modest+Proposal+by+Jonathan+Swift&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Modest_Proposal.html?hl=&id=yDrBywEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yDrBywEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'The full title of Swift&#39;s pamphlet is &quot;A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'CwEXtwEACAAJ', 'etag': '3A+dIolKgn0', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CwEXtwEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to Their Parents Or the Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick', 'authors': ['Jonathan Swift'], 'publisher': 'Gale Ecco, Print Editions', 'publishedDate': '2018-04-22', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

This engaging summary presents an analysis of A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift, a satirical essay which purports to solve the problem of poverty in Ireland. Specifically, Swift suggests that working-class mothers who are struggling to provide for themselves and their children should sell their infants for food, which would both bring in more money and enable them to get back to work. This deliberately provocative suggestion aimed to draw attention to the plight of Ireland’s poor and the callous disregard with which they were treated by the aristocracy and the British elites. Jonathan Swift was an Irish writer who was well known for his satirical works, including the novel Gulliver’s Travels.
