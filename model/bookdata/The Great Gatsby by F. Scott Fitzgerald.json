Scott Fitzgerald's Novel, Enriched by Andrew Hole's Historical Introduction (Contains Original Photos)", 'authors': ['Oldpress', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald'], 'publishedDate': '2021-09-29', 'description': 'Haven\'\'t read The Great Gatsby yet? Here are 3 good reasons to do it (and to suggest it to your friends) 1 - You won\'\'t get bored If boredom is not your thing, this is the book for you. Given its age (the first edition came out in 1925) you might be led to think of this work as "a boulder", a heavy piece of writing, but this is not the case. Fitzgerald\'\'s style is dynamic, the writing brilliant and expressive. Do not be bored! 2 - You\'\'ll Get Richer No, you won\'\'t make a ton of money reading The Great Gatsby, but you will enrich your knowledge by immersing yourself up to the tip of your hair in the unrepeatable era that was "The Roaring Twenties." Jay Gatsby will take you to a New York of parties, alcohol, beautiful women, and jazz music. You\'\'ll take a ride on the merry-go-round of the American dream... before it breaks down. 3 - You\'\'ll be able to say you\'\'ve read "A Real Disaster". Yep, it\'\'s not all gold that glitters. If it is true that today The Great Gatsby is considered a masterpiece of American literature, it is equally true that when it was released in bookstores (on April 10, 1925) the reception was not at all what was expected. Most critics agreed that it was "A Real Disaster". The first review ever to be written in New York, just two days after publication, was titled "F. Scott Fitzgerald\'\'s Last Disaster." Not Just Gatsby What you will find in this volume is the original 1925 edition. No changes of any kind have been made to Fitzgerald\'\'s text, not even a small correction! We think that\'\'s only fair: to respect originality! but... We have enhanced the work by adding a historical introduction by Andrew Hole. Andrew will take you hand in hand and accompany you in the 20\'\'s. He will make you understand why that period was extraordinary and for many reasons unrepeatable. A real journey into the heart of the problems that Fitzgerald\'\'s American generation had to face. Here\'\'s what you\'\'ll find in this volume: The original work The Great Gatsby from 1925 The Birth of Consumerism Women\'\'s Emancipation The Discovery of Jazz The Prohibition American Isolationism The Great Depression ...all illustrated with original period photos! Curious? I want to give you a gift! Behind every great work are often hidden curiosities and anecdotes. The Great Gatsby is no exception. I want to tell you a few: A masterpiece born of failure Before writing his spiritual legacy to humanity, Fitzgerald worked for about a year and a half on writing a play that he believed would make him Broadway\'\'s most popular playwright. The play was titled The Vegetable, or from President to Postman. In September 1923 The Vegetable was staged for the first time in Atlantic City: it was a total fiasco. The show was considered mediocre and poorly written. The author had entered the spiral of alcoholism and was in desperate need of money, so he decided to concentrate on writing the novel. Hemingway Disgusted Ernest Hemingway, a great friend of Fitzgerald\'\'s, called the cover of The Great Gatsby "the ugliest cover I have ever seen." The Title is to be Changed Francis Scott Fitzgerald did not like the title The Great Gatsby. Before its publication he tried many times to change the publisher\'\'s mind. His proposals were: Among the Ash-Heaps and Millionaires, Trimalchio in West Egg, Gold-Hatted Gatsby, The High-Bouncing Lover, On the Road to West Egg or, simply, Gatsby. No dice, the publisher wasn\'\'t convinced even when Fitzgerald suggested Under the Red, White and Blue... Lucky for us! As you can see there are 1000 reasons why you should read this revolutionary work.

Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby “I hope she\'ll be a fool -- that\'s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” --- F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\'s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald, inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\'s north shore, began planning the novel in 1923 desiring to produce, in his words, "something new—something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." Progress was slow with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was too vague and convinced the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was ambivalent about the book\'s title, at various times wishing to re-title the novel Trimalchio in West Egg. First published by Scribner\'s in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly; in its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title "Great American Novel". The book is consistently ranked among the greatest works of American literature. In 1998 the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\'s best American novel and second best novel in the English language.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '150087664X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781500876647'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 126, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 3031, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CLWuoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CLWuoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=CLWuoQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Great+Gatsby+by+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=CLWuoQEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Great+Gatsby+by+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Great_Gatsby.html?hl=&id=CLWuoQEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CLWuoQEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was too vague and convinced the author to revise over the next winter.

Originally entitled Tremalchio, the novel was extensively revised at the galley stage, and emerged with a new title: The Great Gatsby. The novel sold poorly, however, and it was not until after Fitzgerald’s death in 1940 that The Great Gatsby began to be regarded as his greatest work—and by many as the great American novel. When Nick Carraway rents a cottage in an exclusive part of Long Island, he becomes curious about his neighbour in the mansion next door, where extravagant parties extend into the early hours. Jay Gatsby turns out to care little for partying, but is obsessed with winning back Daisy Buchanan, an early love who is now married and living just across the water.

Reading F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Trimalchio, an early and complete version of The Great Gatsby, is like listening to a familiar musical composition played in a different key. It is the same work and yet a different work. Fitzgerald wrote Trimalchio during the summer of 1924 and submitted it to Maxwell Perkins, his editor at Scribner’s, in October of that year. (He titled the book after the ostentatious party-giver in the Satyricon of Petronius.) Perkins had the novel set in type and sent the galleys to Fitzgerald in France. Fitzgerald then heavily revised the galley pages, shifting material around and changing the title. The result was The Great Gatsby, his signature work. Trimalchio, however, is also a remarkable achievement. It differs considerably from The Great Gatsby: its plot and structure are not the same, two chapters of Trimalchio were completely rewritten for the published novel, characterization is different, Nick Carraway’s narrative voice is altered, and it contains several passages and sequences missing from Gatsby.

It tells of the mysterious Jay Gatsby’s grand effort to win the love of Daisy Buchanan, the rich girl who embodies for him the promise of the American dream. Deeply romantic in its concern with self making, ideal love, and the power of illusion, it draws on modernist techniques to capture the spirit of the materialistic, morally adrift, post-war era that Fitzgerald dubbed “the jazz age.” Gatsby’s aspirations remain inseparable from the rhythms and possibilities suggested by modern consumer culture, popular song, and the movies, while his obstacles remain inseparable from contemporary American anxieties about social mobility, racial mongrelization, and the fate of Western civilization. This Broadview edition sets the novel in context by providing readers with a critical introduction and crucial background material about the consumer culture in which Fitzgerald was immersed, the novel’s composition and reception, and the jazz age. The second edition has been updated throughout, with expanded writings on race and immigration in 1920s America from Anzia Yezierska, Alain Locke, and others.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781770488212'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1770488219'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '0.2.2.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=title:The+Great+Gatsby+by+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 11.28, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 7.67, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rDpIEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 11280000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 7670000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}}]}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/The_Great_Gatsby_Second_Edition-sample-epub.acsm?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/The_Great_Gatsby_Second_Edition-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rDpIEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication <b>Title: The great Gatsby</b> / <b>F.

Basic knowledge of the Go language is assumed. Experience with back-end application development is not necessary, but may help understand the motivation behind some of the recipes. What You Will Learn Test your application using advanced testing methodologies Develop an awareness of application structures, interface design, and tooling Create strategies for third-party packages, dependencies, and vendoring Get to know tricks on treating data such as collections Handle errors and cleanly pass them along to calling functions Wrap dependencies in interfaces for ease of portability and testing Explore reactive programming design patterns in Go In Detail Go (a.k.a. Golang) is a statically-typed programming language first developed at Google. It is derived from C with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types, and a large standard library. This book takes off where basic tutorials on the language leave off. You can immediately put into practice some of the more advanced concepts and libraries offered by the language while avoiding some of the common mistakes for new Go developers. The book covers basic type and error handling. It explores applications that interact with users, such as websites, command-line tools, or via the file system. It demonstrates how to handle advanced topics such as parallelism, distributed systems, and performance tuning. Lastly, it finishes with reactive and serverless programming in Go. Style and approach This guide is a handy reference for developers to quickly look up Go development patterns. It is a companion to other resources and a reference that will be useful long after reading it through the first time.

Scott Fitzgerald'], 'publisher': 'BoD - Books on Demand', 'publishedDate': '2021-01-01', 'description': 'THE GREAT GATSBY is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\'s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\'s north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, "something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book\'s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title "Great American Novel." In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\'s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9782322271917'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '2322271918'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 196, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.0.1.0.preview.1', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=title:The+Great+Gatsby+by+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&dq=title:The+Great+Gatsby+by+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Great_Gatsby.html?hl=&id=6p0REAAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/The_Great_Gatsby-sample-pdf.acsm?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6p0REAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies.
