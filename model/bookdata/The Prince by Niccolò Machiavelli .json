Niccoló Machiavelli drew on his own experience of office under the turbulent Florentine republic, rejecting traditional values of political theory and recognizing the complicated, transient nature of political life. Concerned not with lofty ideal but with a regime that would last, The Prince has become the bible of realpolitik, and it still retains its power to alarm and to instruct. In this edition, Machiavelli's tough-minded and pragmatic Italian is preserved in George Bull's clear, unambiguous translation.

The way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the Renaissance has been the subject of many academic discussions, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important. Machiavelli said that The Prince would be about princedoms, mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere, but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also, and one with many strengths.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (About Principalities). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli\'s death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of The Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante\'s Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.BOOK TWO: The Art of WarIs a treatise by the Italian Renaissance political philosopher and historian Niccol� Machiavelli.The format of The Art of War is a socratic dialogue. The purpose, declared by Lord Fabrizio Colonna (perhaps Machiavelli\'s persona) at the outset, "To honor and reward virt�, not to have contempt for poverty, to esteem the modes and orders of military discipline, to constrain citizens to love one another, to live without factions, to esteem less the private than the public good." To these ends, Machiavelli notes in his preface, the military is like the roof of a palazzo protecting the contents.Written between 1519 and 1520 and published the following year, it was Machiavelli\'s only historical or political work printed during his lifetime, though he was appointed official historian of Florence in 1520 and entrusted with minor civil duties.BOOK THREE:The Discourses on Livy Is a work of political history and philosophy written in the early 16th century (ca. 1517) by the Italian writer and political theorist Niccol� Machiavelli, best known as the author of The Prince. The Discourses were published posthumously with papal privilege in 1531.The title identifies the work\'s subject as the first ten books of Livy\'s Ab urbe condita,which relate the expansion of Rome through the end of the Third Samnite War in 293 BCE, although Machiavelli discusses what can be learned from many other eras including contemporary politics. Machiavelli saw history in general as a way to learn useful lessons from the past for the present, and also as a type of analysis which could be built upon, as long as each generation did not forget the works of the past.BOOK FOUR: HISTORY OF FLORENCE After the crisis of 1513, with arrests for conspiracy, torture and after being sentenced to house arrest, Machiavelli\'s relationship with the Medici family passively began to mend itself. If the dedication of Il Principe (1513) to Lorenzo II de\' Medici had not any effect, part of the then dominant faction of the Florence was not against him, and instead granted him an appointment.In his letter he deplores of his idle state, offering his precious political experience to the new lord. To sustain that timid request Machiavelli, with a considerably courtier-like spirit, set his Mandragola for the wedding of Lorenzino de\' Medici (1518). In 1520, he was invited to Lucca for a mission of a semiprivate character, indicating that the ostracism was to be raised up. At the end of that year, Giulio Cardinal de Medici commissioned him to write a History of Florence. Although this was not exactly the charge he desired, Machiavelli accepted it as the only possible way to come back into the graces of the Medici. The intent of the work, although semi-officially, was to recover the city\'s charge of historic officiality. The wage for the appointment was not large (57 florins per year, later increased to 100).', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1973921979'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781973921974'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 638, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=XcCqswEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Prince+by+Niccol%C3%B2+Machiavelli&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=XcCqswEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Prince+by+Niccol%C3%B2+Machiavelli&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Nicolo_Machiavelli_the_Complete_Collecti.html?hl=&id=XcCqswEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XcCqswEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.BOOK TWO: The ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'hpcZswEACAAJ', 'etag': '9rn30qqu0ZQ', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hpcZswEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Prince', 'authors': ['Niccolò Machiavelli'], 'publishedDate': '2015-06-22', 'description': 'The Prince is a 16th-century political treatise by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli.

It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics.Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli\'s works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "Machiavellian" into usage as a pejorative.

Written by a Florentine nobleman whose name has become a synonym for crafty plotting, it is a fascinating political and social document, as pertinent today as when it first appeared. After a lifetime of winning and losing at the game of politics, Machiavelli set down for all time its ageless rules and moves, in this highly readable formula for the man who seeks power. At a time before modern democracy, Machiavelli was less concerned with right and wrong than with currying favor with the ruling Medicis, and his work came to be thought of as a blueprint for dictators.

He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy or political science. For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is of high importance to historians and scholars. He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. Machiavelli\'s name came to evoke unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli advised most famously in The Prince. Machiavelli considered political battles, not through a lens of morality, but as though they are a board game with established rules. His experience showed him that politics have always been played with deception, treachery and crime. He also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic, and is criticized for his deeds, including violence, should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial. Machiavelli\'s Prince was much read as a manuscript long before it was published in 1532 and the reaction was mixed. Some considered it a straightforward description of "the evil means used by bad rulers; others read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power."', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1716075939'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781716075933'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 104, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vh49zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vh49zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=Vh49zgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Prince+by+Niccol%C3%B2+Machiavelli&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=Vh49zgEACAAJ&dq=title:The+Prince+by+Niccol%C3%B2+Machiavelli&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Niccolo_Machiavelli_The_Prince_Illustrat.html?hl=&id=Vh49zgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Vh49zgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (3 May 1469 - 21 June 1527) was an Italian Renaissance diplomat, philosopher and writer, best known for The Prince (Il Principe), written in 1513.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'gN2UzQEACAAJ', 'etag': '9BG+DXth77c', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gN2UzQEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli', 'authors': ['Maisha Books', 'Niccolò Machiavelli'], 'publishedDate': '2019-10-24', 'description': 'The Prince is a 16th-century political treatise by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli.
