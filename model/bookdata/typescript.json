No prior knowledge of TypeScript is required, but a basic understanding of jQuery is expected. This Learning Path is also for experienced TypeScript developers who want to take their skills to the next level, and also for web developers who wish to make the most of TypeScript. What You Will Learn Understand the key TypeScript language features and runtime Install and configure the necessary tools in order to start developing an application Create object-oriented code that adheres to the SOLID principles Develop robust applications with testing (Mocha, Chai, and SinonJS) Apply GoF patterns in an application with a testing approach Identify the challenges when developing an application Migrate JavaScript codebases to TypeScript to improve your workflow Utilize System.JS and Webpack to load scripts and their dependencies Develop high performance server-side applications to run within Node.js In Detail TypeScript is an open source and cross-platform typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or any host. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications. Through this three-module learning path, you'll learn the ins-and-outs of TypeScript for building more robust software. The first module gets you started with TypeScript and helps you understand the basics of TypeScript and automation tools. Get a detailed description of function, generics, callbacks, and promises, and discover the object-oriented features and memory management functionality of TypeScript. The next module starts by explaining the current challenges when designing and developing an application and how you can solve these challenges by applying the correct design pattern and best practices. You will be introduced to low-level programming concepts to help you write TypeScript code, as well as working with software architecture, best practices, and design aspects. The final module will help you build a complete single page app with Angular 2, create a neat mobile app using NativeScript, and even build a Pac Man game with TypeScript. As if the fun wasn't enough, you'll also find out how to migrate your legacy codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript.

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.
