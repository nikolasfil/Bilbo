Noted for her beauty and cleverness, Emma is somewhat wasted in the small village of Highbury but takes a great deal of pride in her matchmaking skills. Unique among other women her age, she has no particular need to marry: she is in the unique situation of not needing a husband to supply her fortune.At the beginning of the novel, Emma's governess, Miss Taylor, has just married Mr. Weston, a wealthy ma who owns Randalls, a nearby estate. Without Miss Taylor as a companion, Emma feels suddenly lonely and decides to adopt the orphan Harriet Smith as a protègè. Harriet lives at a nearby boarding school and knows nothing of her parents. Emma concludes that Harriet's father must have been a gentleman and advises the innocent Harriet in virtually all things, including her choice of society. She suggests that Harriet does not spend any more time with the Martins, a local family of farmers whose son, Robert, has paid Harriet much attention.

The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency Engl∧ she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters. Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like." In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich." Emma, however, is also rather spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people\'s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray. Emma Woodhouse, aged 20 at the start of the novel, is a young, beautiful, witty, and privileged woman in Regency England. She lives on the fictional estate of Hartfield in Surrey in the village of Highbury with her elderly widowed father, who is excessively concerned for his health and that of his loved ones. Emma\'s friend and only critic is the gentlemanly George Knightley, her neighbour from the adjacent estate of Donwell, and the brother of her elder sister Isabella\'s husband, John. As the novel opens, Emma has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her best friend and former governess. Having introduced Miss Taylor to her future husband, Mr. Weston, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she rather likes matchmaking. Against Mr. Knightley\'s advice, Emma forges ahead with her new interest, and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith, a sweet, pretty, but none-too-bright parlour boarder of seventeen--described as "the natural [i.e., illegitimate] daughter of somebody"--to Mr. Elton, the local vicar. Emma becomes convinced that Mr. Elton\'s constant attentions are a result of his attraction and growing love for Harriet. But before events can unfold as she plans, Emma must first persuade Harriet to refuse an advantageous marriage proposal. Her suitor is a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young farmer, Robert Martin, but Emma decides he isn\'t good enough for Harriet. Against her own wishes, the easily influenced Harriet rejects Mr. Martin.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1512145998'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781512145991'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 260, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O9LZsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O9LZsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=O9LZsgEACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=O9LZsgEACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Emma.html?hl=&id=O9LZsgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=O9LZsgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': '&#39;A Must Read.....&#39; Emma By Jane Austen A Lively Comedy of Manners Classic Novels Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance.

As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters and depicts issues of marriage, gender, age, and social status.Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like." In the first sentence, she introduces the title character as "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich." Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people\'s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.Emma, written after Austen\'s move to Chawton, was the last novel to be completed and published during her life, since Persuasion, the last novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.This novel has been adapted for several films, many television programmes, and a long list of stage plays. It is also the inspiration for several novels.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1978117566'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781978117563'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 226, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Emma_Global_Classics.html?hl=&id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jJ4xvgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': '&quot; Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people&#39;s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.Emma, ...'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'NHe2AQAACAAJ', 'etag': '+T82U13cW40', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NHe2AQAACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Emma', 'subtitle': 'Novel', 'authors': ['Jane Austen'], 'publishedDate': '2017-01-27', 'description': 'Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters.Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like."[2] In the first sentence, she introduces the title character as "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich." Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people\'s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray...Plot summary : Emma Woodhouse has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her friend and former governess, to Mr Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she likes matchmaking. After she returns home to Hartfield with her father, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of her brother-in-law Mr Knightley and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith to Mr Elton, the local vicar. First, Emma must persuade Harriet to refuse the marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young farmer, which Harriet does against her own wishes. However, Mr Elton, a social climber, thinks Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma tells him that she had thought him attached to Harriet, he is outraged. After Emma rejects him, Mr Elton leaves for a stay at Bath and returns with a pretentious, nouveau-riche wife, as Mr Knightley expected. Harriet is heartbroken and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her.Frank Churchill, Mr Weston\'s son, arrives for a two-week visit to his father and makes many friends. Frank was adopted by her wealthy and domineering aunt and he has had very few opportunities to visit before. Mr Knightley suggests to Emma that, while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a shallow character. Jane Fairfax also comes home to see her aunt, Miss Bates, and grandmother, Mrs Bates, for a few months, before she must go out on her own as a governess due to her family\'s financial situation...Extrait : Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister\'s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\'s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached...Biography : Jane Austen (/ˈdʒeɪn ˈɒstɪn/; 16 December 1775 - 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen\'s plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility...', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1520474482'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781520474489'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 376, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=NHe2AQAACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=NHe2AQAACAAJ&dq=title:Emma+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Emma.html?hl=&id=NHe2AQAACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NHe2AQAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance.
