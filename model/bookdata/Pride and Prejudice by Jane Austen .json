Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen\'s memorable characters or themes."Pride and Prejudice" is one of the best sociological studies about early nineteen century British loyalty and society I have ever read - where title, rank, fortune, and good looks are in many ways the requirements of an approved marriage, much, much more than love. In fact, this wonderful book might not be as relevant today as two hundred years ago, but there are still many traces of such societies throughout the world, today. It was not all that long ago in America, where marrying outside of your religion, or ethnicity, was looked down upon.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1795179082'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781795179089'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 285, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=CrYNzAEACAAJ&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=CrYNzAEACAAJ&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Pride_and_Prejudice_by_Jane_Austen.html?hl=&id=CrYNzAEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CrYNzAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'In fact, this wonderful book might not be as relevant today as two hundred years ago, but there are still many traces of such societies throughout the world, today.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'jswuAgAAQBAJ', 'etag': 'CdVlh0cRjEk', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jswuAgAAQBAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Pride en Prejudice en Zombies', 'authors': ['Jane Austen', 'Seth Grahame-Smith'], 'publisher': 'Atlas Contact', 'publishedDate': '2010-05-26', 'description': 'Een verrassende nieuwe versie van de roman van Jane Austen, waarin de doden weer tot leven komen. Iedereen is het erover eens dat een zombie die hersens bezit, behoefte heeft aan meer hersens Pride & Prejudice & Zombies: een verrassende nieuwe versie van de beroemde roman van Jane Austen. Er waart een mysterieuze ziekte in het stille Engelse dorp Meryton rond waardoor de doden weer tot leven komen. Elizabeth Bennet is van plan de zombies uit te schakelen, maar ze wordt al snel afgeleid door de komst van de afstandelijke en arrogante meneer Darcy. Wat volgt is een sprankelend, komisch verhaal over trots en vooroordelen van beide hoofdpersonen die ook vaak op slagvelden vol zombies te vinden zijn. Zal Elizabeth het duivelsgebroed weten te verdelgen? En zal ze uiteindelijk de ware vinden? Vol romantiek, zwaardgevechten, en duizenden rottende lijken is Pride & Prejudice & Zombies dé nieuwe versie van een klassieker die je graag wilt lezen. De beroemde negentiende-eeuwse auteur Jane Austen heeft diverse meesterwerken geschreven, waaronder Emma en Sense & Sensibility. Seth Grahame-Smithheeft de klassieker Pride & Prejudice herschreven en woont in Los Angeles.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789025434939'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9025434932'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 206, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.1.2.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'nl', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&dq=title:Pride+and+Prejudice+by+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Pride_en_Prejudice_en_Zombies.html?hl=&id=jswuAgAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/Pride_en_Prejudice_en_Zombies-sample-epub.acsm?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books/download/Pride_en_Prejudice_en_Zombies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jswuAgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Iedereen is het erover eens dat een zombie die hersens bezit, behoefte heeft aan meer hersens Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies: een verrassende nieuwe versie van de beroemde roman van Jane Austen.'}}]}
