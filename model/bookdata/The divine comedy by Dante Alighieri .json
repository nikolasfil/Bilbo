He is attacked by a lion, a leopard, and a she-wolf and cannot find a way out to safety, or in the religious context of the poem, salvation. This situation is represented by a mountain obscuring the sun. He is ultimately rescued by Virgil who guides them through the underworld.

The punishments for the sins of each circle vary.After surviving the journey through Hell, Virgil leads Dante to Purgatory, a mountain on the far side of the world that was formed upon Hell\'s creation. The mountain has seven terraces representing the seven deadly sins. In the realm of Purgatory, sins are classified more based on one\'s motives than on one\'s actions.

It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem\'s imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.On the surface, the poem describes Dante\'s travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven; but at a deeper level, it represents, allegorically, the soul\'s journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy and the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse".The work was originally simply titled Comedï¿½a and the word Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio. The first printed edition to add the word divina to the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce,published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de\' Ferrari.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1540419738'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781540419736'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 118, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&dq=title:The+divine+comedy+by+Dante+Alighieri&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&dq=title:The+divine+comedy+by+Dante+Alighieri&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Divine_Comedy_the_Vision_of_Hell_Pur.html?hl=&id=z3H5MAAACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'The first printed edition to add the word divina to the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce,published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de&#39; Ferrari.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'qSH0AAAAQBAJ', 'etag': '9LHcqpPqb2Q', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qSH0AAAAQBAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': "Dante's Inferno: The Divine Comedy, Book One", 'authors': ['Dante Alighieri'], 'publisher': 'Wildside Press LLC', 'publishedDate': '2013-05-21', 'description': 'In his introduction, the translator says: "I suppose that a very great majority of English-speaking people, if they were asked to name the greatest epic poet of the Christian era in Western Europe, would answer Dante." THE DIVINE COMEDY continues to be widely read today, whether for its religious inspiration or for the sheer power of its verse. The first part of the epic, THE INFERNO, tells how the narrator "loses his way," and finds himself in a strange landscape he\'s never seen before. There he encounters the shade of the ancient Roman poet, Virgil, who offers to lead him through the nine circles of Hell. The damned of Dante\'s imagination, it\'s quite clear, have condemned themselves through their actions or inactions to become permanent prisoners of the nether regions. Down, down, down, go Dante and his guide, meeting friend and foe alike, with horror piled upon horror.
