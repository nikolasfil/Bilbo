It is a spiritual journey expounding the evils of sin through the first-person narration of the aptly named main character, Dante the Pilgrim. The title, The Divine Comedy, is not an implication that the poem is humorous in nature. Rather, the poem is a "comedy" in that it is of the classical style that existed in partnership with tragedy. Traditional tragedies had plotlines that began with an optimistic, or positive, event but ended in sadness, death, or a downtrodden existence. Comedy, considered a base genre, flowed in the opposite direction with tragedy, or at least unhappiness, reaching a happy or optimistic culmination.Pilgrim\'s journey through the realms of the dead lasts from the eve of Good Friday to the Wednesday following Easter in the year 1300. The Roman poet Virgil is Pilgrim\'s guide through Hell and Purgatory. Beatrice, who represents Dante\'s ideal woman, leads passage through Heaven. Given its religious significance, it is not surprising that The Divine Comedy is structured as a trinity. The three aforementioned sections in literary terms are known as canticas and total 14,233 lines. Each cantica is made up of thirty-three cantos, once again giving significance to the number "three." The poem has an introduction, which is considered part of the first cantica, thus giving the work a total of one hundred cantos.The opening section of the poem, Inferno, finds Dante lost in sin, symbolically depicted as a dark wood. He is attacked by a lion, a leopard, and a she-wolf and cannot find a way out to safety, or in the religious context of the poem, salvation. This situation is represented by a mountain obscuring the sun. He is ultimately rescued by Virgil who guides them through the underworld. Every sin in Inferno has a punishment that symbolically, even ironically, levels justice. As an example, sinful seers or fortune-tellers are destined to walk with their heads attached facing backward so as to be unable to do what they did in life: see what is yet to come. The three animals that attack Dante symbolize the sins of being self-indulgent, violent, and malicious. Hell is structured as nine circles into which sinners are classified. Those suffering from incontinence or lack of restraint fall into circles one through five. Pride or violence make up circles six and seven. Fraud and malice are the sins connected to circles eight and nine. Each of the circles signifies deeper and deeper evil ending in the earth\'s core, the realm of Satan. The punishments for the sins of each circle vary.After surviving the journey through Hell, Virgil leads Dante to Purgatory, a mountain on the far side of the world that was formed upon Hell\'s creation. The mountain has seven terraces representing the seven deadly sins. In the realm of Purgatory, sins are classified more based on one\'s motives than on one\'s actions. Theologically, there is a Christian basis although Dante does not rely exclusively on the Bible. Love is a significant theme in The Divine Comedy. Love becomes sinful when driven by pride, envy, or wrath. It is also sinful when it is sloth or weak, or too strong via lust, gluttony, or greed. An additional region of Purgatory is the Ante-Purgatory home of those excommunicated from the church and those who died who may have been repentant but had not received rites.

It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem\'s imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.On the surface, the poem describes Dante\'s travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven; but at a deeper level, it represents, allegorically, the soul\'s journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy and the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse".The work was originally simply titled Comed�a and the word Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio. The first printed edition to add the word divina to the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce,published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de\' Ferrari.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1540419738'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781540419736'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 118, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&dq=title:The+divine+comedy+by+Dante+Alighieri&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&dq=title:The+divine+comedy+by+Dante+Alighieri&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Divine_Comedy_the_Vision_of_Hell_Pur.html?hl=&id=z3H5MAAACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=z3H5MAAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'The first printed edition to add the word divina to the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce,published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de&#39; Ferrari.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'qSH0AAAAQBAJ', 'etag': '9LHcqpPqb2Q', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qSH0AAAAQBAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': "Dante's Inferno: The Divine Comedy, Book One", 'authors': ['Dante Alighieri'], 'publisher': 'Wildside Press LLC', 'publishedDate': '2013-05-21', 'description': 'In his introduction, the translator says: "I suppose that a very great majority of English-speaking people, if they were asked to name the greatest epic poet of the Christian era in Western Europe, would answer Dante." THE DIVINE COMEDY continues to be widely read today, whether for its religious inspiration or for the sheer power of its verse. The first part of the epic, THE INFERNO, tells how the narrator "loses his way," and finds himself in a strange landscape he\'s never seen before. There he encounters the shade of the ancient Roman poet, Virgil, who offers to lead him through the nine circles of Hell. The damned of Dante\'s imagination, it\'s quite clear, have condemned themselves through their actions or inactions to become permanent prisoners of the nether regions. Down, down, down, go Dante and his guide, meeting friend and foe alike, with horror piled upon horror.
