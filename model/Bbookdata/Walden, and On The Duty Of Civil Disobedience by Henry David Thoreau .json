In it, Thoreau argues that individuals should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that they have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). In 1848, Thoreau gave lectures at the Concord Lyceum entitled "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government". This formed the basis for his essay, which was first published under the title Resistance to Civil Government in a 1849 anthology by Elizabeth Peabody called Æsthetic Papers. The latter title distinguished Thoreau\'s program from that of the "non-resistants" (anarcho-pacifists) who were expressing similar views. Resistance also served as part of Thoreau\'s metaphor comparing the government to a machine: when the machine was producing injustice, it was the duty of conscientious citizens to be "a counter friction" (i.e., a resistance) "to stop the machine". In 1866, four years after Thoreau\'s death, the essay was reprinted in a collection of Thoreau\'s work (A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform Papers) under the title Civil Disobedience. Today, the essay also appears under the title On the Duty of Civil Disobedience, perhaps to contrast it with William Paley\'s Of the Duty of Civil Obedience to which Thoreau was in part responding. For instance, the 1960 New American Library Signet Classics edition of Walden included a version with this title. On Civil Disobedience is another common title. The word civil has several definitions. The one that is intended in this case is "relating to citizens and their interrelations with one another or with the state", and so civil disobedience means "disobedience to the state". Author.Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 - May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay "Civil Disobedience" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. Thoreau\'s books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and Yankee attention to practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life\'s true essential needs. He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau\'s philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist. Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government--"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government" the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism: "\'That government is best which governs not at all;\' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1977015131'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781977015136'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 25, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 6, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jBJNtgEACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=jBJNtgEACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_Duty_of_Civil_Disobedience.html?hl=&id=jBJNtgEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jBJNtgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Today, the essay also appears under the title On the Duty of Civil Disobedience, perhaps to contrast it with William Paley&#39;s Of the Duty of Civil Obedience to which Thoreau was in part responding.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'fnLizQEACAAJ', 'etag': 'jfoNi3gEpYc', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fnLizQEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Walden And On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience By Henry David Thoreau Illustrated Novel', 'authors': ['Henry David Thoreau'], 'publishedDate': '2020-09-20', 'description': 'Resistance to Civil Government, known as Civil Disobedience for short, is an essay through American transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau that turned into first posted in 1849.

Simple living and self-sufficiency were Thoreau\'s other goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy, a central theme of the American Romantic Period.Thoreau makes precise scientific observations of nature as well as metaphorical and poetic uses of natural phenomena. He identifies many plants and animals by both their popular and scientific names, records in detail the color and clarity of different bodies of water, precisely dates and describes the freezing and thawing of the pond, and recounts his experiments to measure the depth and shape of the bottom of the supposedly "bottomless" Walden Pond. Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 - May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, and philosopher. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay "Civil Disobedience" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.Thoreau\'s books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and Yankee attention to practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life\'s true essential needs.He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau\'s philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist. Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government-"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government"-the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: "\'That government is best which governs not at all;\' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1672452945'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781672452946'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 168, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8betzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8betzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=8betzAEACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=8betzAEACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Walden_and_On_The_Duty_Of_Civil_Disobedi.html?hl=&id=8betzAEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8betzAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Walden ( first published as Walden; or, Life in the Woods) is a book by transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau.

In it, Thoreau argues that individuals should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that they have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War (1846-1848).In 1848, Thoreau gave lectures at the Concord Lyceum entitled "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government."This formed the basis for his essay, which was first published under the title Resistance to Civil Government in 1849 in an anthology called Æsthetic Papers. The latter title distinguished Thoreau\'s program from that of the "non-resistants" (anarcho-pacifists) who were expressing similar views. Resistance also served as part of Thoreau\'s metaphor comparing the government to a machine: when the machine was producing injustice, it was the duty of conscientious citizens to be "a counter friction" (i.e., a resistance) "to stop the machine."In 1866, four years after Thoreau\'s death, the essay was reprinted in a collection of Thoreau\'s work (A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform Papers) under the title Civil Disobedience. Today, the essay also appears under the title On the Duty of Civil Disobedience, perhaps to contrast it with William Paley\'s Of the Duty of Civil Obedience to which Thoreau was in part responding. For instance, the 1960 New American Library Signet Classics edition of Walden included a version with this title. On Civil Disobedience is another common title.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1536901024'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781536901023'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 74, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eQYAvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eQYAvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=eQYAvgAACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=eQYAvgAACAAJ&dq=title:Walden,+and+On+The+Duty+Of+Civil+Disobedience+by+Henry+David+Thoreau&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Civil_Disobedience_by.html?hl=&id=eQYAvgAACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eQYAvgAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'Today, the essay also appears under the title On the Duty of Civil Disobedience, perhaps to contrast it with William Paley&#39;s Of the Duty of Civil Obedience to which Thoreau was in part responding.'}}]}
