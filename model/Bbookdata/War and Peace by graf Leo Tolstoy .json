It is actually the seventh longest novel ever written in a Latin or Cyrillic based alphabet and is subdivided into four books or volumes, each with sub parts containing many chapters.[citation needed] Tolstoy came up with the title, and some of his themes, from an 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: La Guerre et la Paix (\'War and Peace\' in French).

War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy is an example of classic fiction first published in 1869 in Russia. A true book of worth, a classic that lives on in an era of timeless distinction. Early books exude an excellence unlike any from modern times. You will not be dissatisfied with this work. Historic fiction at its finest. A Glimpse Inside Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv\'s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father\'s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father--who were never favorably disposed toward him--would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father\'s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading--the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. Synopsis War and Peace is a literary work mixed with chapters on history and philosophy by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, first published serially, then published in its entirety in 1869. It is regarded as one of Tolstoy\'s finest literary achievements and remains an internationally praised classic of world literature. The novel chronicles the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869. Tolstoy said War and Peace is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle." Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative. The writer rewrote the novel several times. Tolstoy also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.

Badly wounded at Austerlitz, he begins to discover the emptiness of everything to which he has devoted himself. His death scene is considered one of the greatest passages in Russian literature.The novel's other hero, the bumbling Pierre Bezukhov, tries to find meaning in life through a series of philosophical systems that promise to resolve all questions. He at last discovers the Tolstoyan truth that wisdom is to be found not in systems but in the ordinary processes of daily life, especially in his marriage to the novel's most memorable heroine, Natasha. Both an intimate study of individual passions and an epic history of Russia and its people, War and Peace is nothing more or less than a complete portrait of human existence.

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Set against the sweeping panoply of Napoleon\'s invasion of Russia, War and Peace—presented here in the first new English translation in forty years—is often considered the greatest novel ever written. At its center are Pierre Bezukhov, searching for meaning in his life; cynical Prince Andrei, ennobled by wartime suffering; and Natasha Rostov, whose impulsiveness threatens to destroy her happiness. As Tolstoy follows the changing fortunes of his characters, he crafts a view of humanity that is both epic and intimate and that continues to define fiction at its most resplendent. This edition includes an introduction, note on the translation, cast of characters, maps, notes on the major battles depicted, and chapter summaries. Praise for Antony Brigg\'s translation of War and Peace: "The best translation so far of Tolstoy\'s masterpiece into English." -Robert A. Maguire, professor emeritus of Russian studies, Columbia University "In Tolstoy\'s work part of the translator\'s difficulty lies in conveying not only the simplicity but the subtlety of the book\'s scale and effect. . . .

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world's greatest novels.War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that it was not considered a novel in its time. Indeed, Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1986584526'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781986584524'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 822, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=oVsptQEACAAJ&dq=title:War+and+Peace+by+graf+Leo+Tolstoy&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.gr/books?id=oVsptQEACAAJ&dq=title:War+and+Peace+by+graf+Leo+Tolstoy&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/WAR_and_PEACE_Serialised_1865_1869.html?hl=&id=oVsptQEACAAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'saleability': 'NOT_FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': False}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'GR', 'viewability': 'NO_PAGES', 'embeddable': False, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': False}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oVsptQEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'NONE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'War and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russkii Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era.'}}, {'kind': 'books#volume', 'id': 'QYM_yQEACAAJ', 'etag': 'Vy2RJfTCoqY', 'selfLink': 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QYM_yQEACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'The Greatest Short Stories of Leo Tolstoy', 'authors': ['Leo Tolstoy'], 'publishedDate': '2019-08', 'description': "Wonderfully wide-ranging and enjoyable, this outstanding collection features highly acclaimed short stories by Tolstoy who is regarded as one of the greatest writers in history. Among Russian writers, Leo Tolstoy is probably the best known to the Western world, largely because of War and Peace, his epic in prose, and Anna Karenina, one of the most splendid novels in any language. But during his long lifetime, Tolstoy also wrote enough shorter works to fill many volumes. The seven parts into which this book is divided include 'God Sees the Truth, but Waits' and 'A Prisoner in the Caucasus' which Tolstoy himself considered as his best. 'How Much Land Does a Man Need?' depicting the greed of a peasant for land; the most brilliantly told parable, 'Ivan the Fool'-these are all contained in this volume. The book includes an active table of contents for easy navigation. CONTENTS: PART 1: FOLK-TALES RETOLD 1. The Godson 2. The Empty Drum 3. How Much Land does a Man Need? 4. The Repentant Sinner 5.

Badly wounded at Austerlitz, he begins to discover the emptiness of everything to which he has devoted himself. His death scene is considered one of the greatest passages in Russian literature.The novel's other hero, the bumbling Pierre Bezukhov, tries to find meaning in life through a series of philosophical systems that promise to resolve all questions. He at last discovers the Tolstoyan truth that wisdom is to be found not in systems but in the ordinary processes of daily life, especially in his marriage to the novel's most memorable heroine, Natasha. Both an intimate study of individual passions and an epic history of Russia and its people, War and Peace is nothing more or less than a complete portrait of human existence.
