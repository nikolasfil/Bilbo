24: hamburger view for mobile view for filters

29: controllers in different routes ! 

30: autoincrement id 


Notes: 

make a fetch request to the server to update the session filters 
So that it can bring them up everytime you go to the seach page ?
Maybe nullify it when you from any search bar to the search page, but show them everytime you refresh by using a fetch

for limitations 

31: fix the pagification of search 
Load the pagification first. And then each page fetches with limit and offset = (page per books * page)


32: fix that searching in the search bar takes the filters inside as well . 

33: fix that in general 

35: fix availability query 


36: add more copies , from different libraries 

37: fix the issue that will arise from putting more copies in the libraries. Also the copies available should be coordinated by firstly a query search for availability and secondly a sum of all the copies that exist in different libraries .
