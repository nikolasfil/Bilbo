            <h1>About Bilbo</h1>
            <p>Bilbo is a search engine that helps you find and borrow books from libraries around you. 
              Our purpose is to make finding books and libraries around you as easy as possible in a fun 
              and comprehensive way. 
              Our name is inpsired by Bilbo Baggins, who is a bookworm character from the novels and movies 
              The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

            <h1>Konstantinos Kotorenis</h1>
            <p>My name is Konstantinos or just Koto. I was born in the 15th of October 1998 
              and for the last 7 years I study Electrical and Computer Engineering. My main passion is photography 
              and I love graphic and UI/UX Design a lot. I might not have watched Lord of the Rings, Bilbo stood out
              from the crowd and I think he as a bookwork fits a lot with our vision for the application.
