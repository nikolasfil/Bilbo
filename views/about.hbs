                    <h1>Konstantinos Kotorenis</h1>
                    <p>My name is Konstantinos or just Koto. I was born in the 15th of October 1998
                        and for the last 7 years I study Electrical and Computer Engineering. My main passion is
                        photography
                        and I love graphic and UI/UX Design a lot. I might not have watched Lord of the Rings, Bilbo
                        stood out
                        from the crowd and I think he as a bookwork fits a lot with our vision for the application.
